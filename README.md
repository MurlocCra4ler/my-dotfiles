## Installation

The installation script is designed for a minimal [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) install, but **may** work on some [Arch-based distros](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch-based_distributions).
While installing HyDE alongside another [DE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_environment)/[WM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager) should work, due to it being a heavily customized setup, it **will** conflict with your [GTK](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GTK)/[Qt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Qt) theming, [Shell](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Command-line_shell), [SDDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM), [GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB), etc. and is at your own risk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The install script will auto-detect an NVIDIA card and install nvidia-dkms drivers for your kernel.
> Please ensure that your NVIDIA card supports dkms drivers in the list provided [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA).

> [!CAUTION]
> The script modifies your `grub` or `systemd-boot` config to enable NVIDIA DRM.

To install, execute the following commands: 

```shell
pacman -Sy git
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MurlocCra4ler/my-dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles/Scripts
./install.sh
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also add any other apps you wish to install alongside HyDE to `Scripts/custom_apps.lst` and pass the file as a parameter to install it like so: 
> 
> ```shell
> ./install.sh custom_apps.lst
> ```

As a second install option, you can also use `Hyde-install`, which might be easier for some.
View installation instructions for HyDE in [Hyde-cli - Usage](https://github.com/kRHYME7/Hyde-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

Please reboot after the install script completes and takes you to the SDDM login screen (or black screen) for the first time.
For more details, please refer to the [installation wiki](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots/wiki/Installation).

### Updating
To update HyDE, you will need to pull the latest changes from GitHub and restore the configs by running the following commands: 

```shell
cd ~/dotfiles/Scripts
git pull
./install.sh -r
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that any configurations you made will be overwritten if listed to be done so as listed by `Scripts/restore_cfg.lst`.
> However, all replaced configs are backed up and may be recovered from in `~/.config/cfg_backups`.
